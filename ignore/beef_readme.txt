This paper presents a rigorous comparative analysis of the beef sector in Ireland, encompassing a wide range of key dimensions, including production, consumption, and trade. By leveraging both historical and contemporary data, the paper employs various forecasting models to project future beef prices in the Irish market. Additionally, the study integrates sentiment analysis to extract valuable insights into public perception of the beef industry. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis, the paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the industry, outlining key trends and offering strategic recommendations for relevant stakeholders. The research was carried out by Ronan Downes, with the goal of contributing to ongoing discussions around the optimisation of Ireland's beef sector.

To form a rigorous comparative analysis of the beef sector in Ireland, historical data on key factors such as beef trade prices, land usage for beef production, fertilizer and manure land input practice in the beef production, population and employment trends, climate indicators such as temperature and precipitation, and investment trends especially the European Union's (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) incentives for beef production.

A comparative analysis can was conducted to understand how these various factors impact the Irish beef sector. Patterns and trends in the data led to informed projections about how these factors might influence future beef production and prices.

To develop forecasting models for future beef prices, various methods such as time series analysis, regression analysis, and machine learning algorithms were employed. These models are trained using historical data to make predictions about future beef prices, taking into account the identified trends and factors that impact the beef sector.

Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis of the historical data and projections from forecasting models, it was possible to identify opportunities and challenges for the Irish beef industry, and offer recommendations for stakeholders such as farmers, processors, retailers, and policymakers to optimize the industry for profitability.
