git add . && git commit -m "Added new feature" && git pull origin main && git push origin main

If others have access to your repository and can run the git add . && git commit -m "Added new feature" && git pull origin main && git push origin main command, they will be able to add and commit changes, and then pull and push their changes to the remote repository.

However, if there are conflicts with the changes that they are trying to push, or if they don't have the necessary permissions to push changes to the remote repository, the command may fail.

Additionally, if you are collaborating with others on the same repository, it's important to communicate and coordinate with them to ensure that you're not accidentally overwriting each other's changes. It's generally a good idea to use branching strategies and pull requests to manage changes in a collaborative environment.

In general, it's important to be careful when running any command that affects the state of a repository, and to make sure that you fully understand the implications of the command before running it.
