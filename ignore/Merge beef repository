ronandownes Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/ronandownes/beef

It looks like you're trying to merge the "main" branch of the "beef" repository on GitHub. Is there anything specific you need help with?

what other brances are they

I work in school and then at home on a different pc and shoul they both be pushing to difference plaes
To see what other branches exist in the "beef" repository, you can run the command git branch in the command line while in the local repository directory. This will list all the branches in the repository.

Regarding your second question, if you're working on the same project from different computers, you should make sure that both computers are using the same remote repository on GitHub. This way, any changes you make on one computer can be pushed to the same repository and be accessible from the other computer. You can also use version control tools like Git to help manage changes and ensure that both computers are up-to-date with the latest changes.

for simplicith I run this 

git add . && git commit -m "Added new feature" && git pull origin main && git push origin main
The command you provided will add all changes in your local repository, commit those changes with a message of "Added new feature", pull any changes made to the "main" branch on the remote repository, and finally push your changes to the "main" branch on the remote repository.

This is a common command to use when working on a feature and wanting to push those changes to the remote repository. However, keep in mind that pulling changes from the remote repository before pushing your changes is a good practice to ensure that there are no conflicts with changes made by others.

Also, it's important to note that using "git add ." will add all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories, so make sure you only add the changes you want to commit. You can use git status to check which files have been modified and need to be added to the commit.
