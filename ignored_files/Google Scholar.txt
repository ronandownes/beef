Google Scholar can be a powerful tool for conducting academic research. Here are some tips for using it effectively:

	Start with a clear research question or topic in mind.

	Use relevant keywords related to your research question or topic to search for articles. Use quotation marks around exact phrases to search for specific words in a specific order.

	Use the advanced search options to narrow down your search by author, publication, and date.

	Use the "cited by" feature to find articles that have cited a particular article of interest. This can be useful for finding newer articles that have built upon the research in an older article.

	Read abstracts and summaries to quickly determine if an article is relevant to your research.

	Read the introduction and conclusion of articles to get an overview of the research and its findings.

	Use the "related articles" feature to find other articles that are similar to the one you're reading.

	Save articles to your library to easily refer to them later.

	Don't limit yourself to the first few pages of search results. Dig deeper to find less well-known but relevant articles.

	Keep track of your sources using citation management software like Zotero or Mendeley.
