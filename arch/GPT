what is wrong with this latex in title page 
\href{https://github.com/ronandownes/IRL_EU_Beef_comparative_analysis}{github}
The LaTeX code you provided is not a complete title page and appears to be a hyperlink to a GitHub repository. If you intended to include this link in your title page, you can use the following code:

javascript
Copy code
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\title{Title of your paper}
\author{Your name}
\date{\today}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\href{https://github.com/ronandownes/IRL_EU_Beef_comparative_analysis}{GitHub Repository}
\end{document}
This code includes the hyperref package to enable hyperlinks and uses the \href command to create a hyperlink to the GitHub repository. The \maketitle command creates the title page with the title, author, and date.

Note that you may need to modify the code to fit the formatting requirements of your particular document or publication.

latex /href 
The \href command in LaTeX is used to create a hyperlink to a URL or another part of the document. It is provided by the hyperref package, which must be included in the preamble of the document with the command \usepackage{hyperref}.

The basic syntax of the \href command is as follows:

scss
Copy code
\href{url}{text}
where url is the URL to which the hyperlink should point, and text is the text that should be displayed as the hyperlink.

For example, the following code creates a hyperlink to the LaTeX Project website with the text "LaTeX Project":

javascript
Copy code
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}
Visit the \href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{LaTeX Project} website for more information.
\end{document}
When the PDF is generated, "LaTeX Project" will be displayed as a hyperlink, and clicking on it will open the LaTeX Project website in the user's web browser.
